# Product Orders Application

This project started as an assignment for a Advanced Web Development college course in Fall 2019.

## SUMMARY: 

It is a website for a "store" where users can place an "order" for a product. After the user makes all the necessary selections, the order is saved to the database and a receipt is immediately shown to the user. Users can also search by customer last name to find orders, and then the users can edit the selected order.

Although this is not a real-world project, I would love to hear any suggestions or improvements for the code or the security aspects of it.

## HOW TO: 

To run the project, download/clone this repository into your localhost environment (I use XAMPP with MySQL). To connect it to your localhost database, you can easily configure the settings by editing the connection details found in "inc/connection.php".
